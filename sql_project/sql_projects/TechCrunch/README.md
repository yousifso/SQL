# Startup Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into a database of startups, using SQL queries to analyze company metrics like valuation, funding, and employee counts. The analysis focuses on understanding the startup ecosystem by evaluating the performance and characteristics of companies across different stages and categories.

## Files
- `startup_queries.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for analyzing startup data.

## Queries
1. **Retrieve All Records**: Fetches all data from the `startups` table to view comprehensive information about each company.
2. **Total Number of Companies**: Counts the total number of startups listed in the database.
3. **Total Valuation**: Calculates the combined valuation of all startups to gauge the sector's market value.
4. **Highest Seed Funding**: Determines the maximum funding amount raised by any startup in the 'Seed' stage.
5. **Oldest Company**: Identifies the startup with the earliest founding year.
6. **Average Valuation**: Computes the average valuation of all listed startups.
7. **Average Valuation by Category**: Calculates the average valuation per category and sorts these averages in descending order for a sectoral financial insight.
8. **Count of Companies per Category**: Lists the number of startups in each category where there are more than three companies, providing insights into dominant sectors.
9. **Average Employees by Location**: Assesses the average number of employees per location for locales with more than 500 employees, offering a look at employment impact by region.

## Usage
These queries should be executed on a SQL database system that supports standard SQL operations. They are designed for data analysts, venture capitalists, and startup ecosystem researchers interested in understanding market dynamics and identifying key trends in the startup environment.
