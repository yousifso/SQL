# Rideshare Database Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data from a rideshare company's database, focusing on trips, riders, and cars. It utilizes SQL queries to extract, join, and manipulate data to derive insights about trips, rider engagements, and vehicle usage.

## Files
- `LyftTrip.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for the comprehensive analysis of the rideshare data.

## Queries
1. **Retrieve All Trips**: Fetches all records from the 'trips' table.
2. **Retrieve All Riders**: Fetches all records from the 'riders' table.
3. **Retrieve All Cars**: Fetches all records from the 'cars' table.
4. **Join Riders and Cars**: Combines 'riders' and 'cars' tables to display riders' names alongside the car models they used.
5. **Left Join Trips and Riders**: Merges 'trips' with 'riders' to include rider details in trip records.
6. **Inner Join Trips and Cars**: Joins 'trips' with 'cars' to include car details in trip records.
7. **Union Riders Tables**: Combines records from two riders tables to consolidate similar data.
8. **Average Trip Cost**: Calculates the average cost of all trips.
9. **Filter Riders by Trip Count**: Filters and groups riders who have completed fewer than 500 trips.
10. **Active Cars**: Selects all cars that are currently active.
11. **Top Cars by Trips Completed**: Lists the top 2 cars based on the number of trips completed.

## Usage
Execute the SQL queries within a PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any SQL-compatible database management system. This project is beneficial for data analysts at rideshare companies to understand operational efficiencies and user engagement.
