# Customer Engagement Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This SQL project examines customer engagement across various interaction points, such as surveys, quizzes, home try-ons, and purchases. The goal is to understand how users transition through different stages of the customer journey and to identify opportunities to enhance engagement and conversion rates.

## Files
- `customer_engagement_queries.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for the analysis.

## Queries
1. **Preview Survey Data**: Retrieves the first 10 records from the 'survey' table to get an initial look at the data.
2. **Unique Users per Survey Question**: Counts how many distinct users answered each question in the survey, which helps in understanding the reach and impact of survey questions.
3. **Preview Quiz Data**: Fetches the first 5 records from the 'quiz' table to preview the quiz interactions.
4. **Preview Home Try-On Data**: Retrieves the first 5 records from the 'home_try_on' table to understand initial customer reactions to physical product trials.
5. **Preview Purchase Data**: Shows the first 5 records from the 'purchase' table to see early purchase data.
6. **User Engagement Across Stages**: Joins the 'quiz', 'home_try_on', and 'purchase' tables to analyze user engagement from quiz participation to purchasing, indicating which users moved from trying products at home to making a purchase.

## Usage
Run these queries on a SQL-supported database system to analyze user engagement data. The project is ideal for marketing analysts, data scientists in retail, and customer experience managers looking to improve the sales funnel and customer retention strategies.
