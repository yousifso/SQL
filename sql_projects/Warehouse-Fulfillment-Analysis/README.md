# Warehouse Order Fulfillment Analysis

## Overview
This SQL project analyzes the order fulfillment rates of different warehouses within a company. The goal is to identify how well each warehouse is performing in terms of fulfilling orders relative to the total number of orders processed across the company.

## Technologies Used
- SQL: For querying and aggregating data from multiple tables.
- BigQuery: As the data warehouse and query execution environment.

## Features
- **Order Count by Warehouse**: Calculates how many orders each warehouse has fulfilled.
- **Total Orders Calculation**: A subquery to fetch the total number of orders across all warehouses.
- **Fulfillment Categorization**: Categorizes each warehouse based on their fulfillment rate as low, medium, or high.

## Usage
The query is designed to help logistics managers understand the distribution of order fulfillment across different warehouses, aiding in decision-making about resource allocation and operational improvements.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have access to a BigQuery account.
2. Import the SQL script into your BigQuery environment.
3. Execute the query to view the report.

This project provides valuable insights into the operational efficiency of different warehouses and supports strategic decisions in logistics management.
