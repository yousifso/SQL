# State Climate Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project utilizes SQL queries to analyze state-wise temperature data over several years. The aim is to calculate various temperature metrics, including running averages, extremes, changes over time, and ranking of temperatures. These metrics provide insights into climate trends and anomalies at the state level.

## Files
- `temperature_analysis.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for the detailed temperature analysis.

## Queries
1. **Running Average Temperature**: Computes the running average temperature by state over the years to observe trends.
2. **Lowest Temperature**: Identifies the minimum temperature ever recorded in each state, providing insights into extreme weather conditions.
3. **Highest Temperature**: Captures the maximum temperature recorded in each state to understand the upper extremes of climate.
4. **Change in Temperature**: Analyzes the variation in temperature from the previous record within each state, highlighting significant changes.
5. **Temperature Ranking**: Ranks states within each year by their coldest temperatures to pinpoint the coldest regions.
6. **Temperature Quartiles**: Divides temperatures into quartiles within each state to statistically analyze temperature distributions.
7. **Temperature Quintiles**: Segments temperatures into quintiles across all states for a broader comparative analysis.

## Usage
Run the SQL queries in any SQL database management system that supports window functions, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL 8+, or Microsoft SQL Server. These queries are particularly useful for meteorologists, environmental scientists, and policy-makers interested in understanding long-term climate patterns.
