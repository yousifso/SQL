# Streaming and Chat Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project conducts an analysis of streaming and chat data to understand viewer engagement and preferences across different games and channels. Utilizing SQL queries, the analysis aims to uncover viewer trends, game popularity, and active chat participation.

## Files
- `streaming_chat_queries.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for analyzing the data.

## Queries Overview
1. **Initial Data Preview**: Queries to fetch initial data from 'stream' and 'chat' tables for preliminary viewing.
2. **Distinct Data Extraction**: Queries to extract unique game titles and channel names from streaming data.
3. **Viewership Analysis**: Analyzes the number of viewers per game and also provides viewership details by country specifically for 'League of Legends'.
4. **Player Activity**: Determines the frequency of player appearances in stream data.
5. **Game Genre Classification**: Classifies games into genres like MOBA, FPS, and Survival based on predefined criteria and counts their occurrences.
6. **Time-Based Analysis**: Extracts and manipulates timestamp data to explore patterns in streaming times, specifically looking at time components and hourly activity in the Netherlands.
7. **Data Joining**: Joins streaming and chat data to explore device-based correlations between streaming and chatting activities.

## Usage
- Run the SQL queries in a PostgreSQL or MySQL database that supports SQL standard functions.
- Use the results to strategize content placement, schedule streaming sessions, and enhance viewer engagement.
